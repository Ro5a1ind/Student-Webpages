Rosalind W. ‚Äì Final Portfolio Project

About Me
Hi! My name is Rosalind Wong, and I‚Äôm currently a senior at Mt. Eden High School. This year, I‚Äôve been learning how to turn creative ideas into interactive digital experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building websites that are both fun and functional, and I love adding my own personal aesthetic to every project I make.

What This Project Is
This is my final portfolio project for AP Computer Science. It is a personal website that showcases some of the web development projects I‚Äôve built throughout the year. Each section of my site reflects what I‚Äôve learned, including working with JavaScript logic, styling with CSS, and improving the usability and interactivity of web apps.

Throughout the year, I‚Äôve learned how to:
- Write dynamic and interactive code using JavaScript
- Debug and solve coding problems independently
- Build full web applications and games
- Use functions, conditionals, loops, and events effectively

Overview of My Portfolio Site
My portfolio site includes:
- A welcoming introduction
- An "About Me" section explaining my coding journey
- A collection of project previews with descriptions and links
- A contact section with my school email
- A responsive layout and user-friendly navigation
- A custom project preview modal to showcase my work interactively
